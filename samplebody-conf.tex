\section{Introduction to Visualization problem in Machine Learning}

+ Intro intelligent system that can learn from data.

Our lives are getting better and better thanks to the intelligent systems.
A computer vision system for analyzing medical images can support the doctors to make the diagnosis faster and more accurate.
A smart home equipped with voice controlled devices is made possible due to the innovation in voice recognition and human language understanding system.
They are some of numerous examples of learning system, the system can learn and improve itself from data, which can be million of medical images, voice records or texts in many languages.

+ 2 main types of learning algorithms.

+ Data is complex, high dimensional.

+ The need of visualization.

+ The core algorithm to do viz is DR

+ Intro our work: interactive DR for Viz

\section{The Need of Human-in-the-loop}

+ Algo can make mistakes.

+ Why human can help.

+ How to integrate human knowledge

+ State of the art human interaction method.

\section{Integration of User Interactions into Visualization, the Showcases}

+ Scenario that human can help in visualization

+ Choose some (3) examples (very attractive methods)

\section{Works in Progress and Perspectives}

+ Goal of our current works

+ Interactive with t-SNE and PPCA

+ User-steering viz with constraints.

+ Perspective in the future: multi-aspect
