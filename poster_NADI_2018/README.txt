This directory contains the file nadiposter.cls to produce Nadi
posters in latex. It actually consists in a slight adaptation to Nadi of
the baposter.cls class file, made by J.-M. Jacquet on September 24th
2018.

As an illustration of its use, an example file inspired by
J.-M. Jacquet's research is provided in the file poster.tex. To run
it, simply type

pdflatex poster.tex
